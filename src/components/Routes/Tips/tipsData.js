The soil is starving for organic matter.
<br/>Better garden, better lawn, better flowers, better veggies this summer, how to we do it? With compost.
<br/>Composting is literally making new soil. Have you ever tried it?! It’s like watching magic happen.
<br/>You can take “trash” and turn it into earthly treasure.
<br/>As much as 40% of our food is wasted and sent to landfills. There it produces methane, which accelerates climate change. Can you imagine a giant pile of food — and then taking 40% of it to throw directly into the trash?!
But there is never any waste in nature. Everything that dies becomes food for something else. By composting, we can participate in the natural flow of life and recycle vital nutrients back into our soil.
<br/>Composting May Be More Profound Than We Ever Thought
<br/>Only recently, Project Drawdown, an organization led by environmental researcher, Paul Hawken, produced a phenomenal report ranking the 100 Top Solutions for Climate Change. Their efforts specifically focused only on hard data, to ensure the research was backed up with bulletproof evidence, and so no one could discredit their arguments.
<br/>What they found surprised them...
<br/>After factoring in the methane emissions from food waste in landfills, reducing food waste turns out to be the number 1 solution overall to help heal our planet!
<br/>Want to find out how you can grow fabulous compost, even if you don’t have much space (and without creating bad smells, offending the neighbors, or attracting unwanted critters!)? Expert gardening teacher, Stacey Murphy, joined me to create a powerful video walking you through the simplest steps to get anyone and everyone turning food scraps into healthy new soil gold! And this is just ONE of the 15 expert video lessons included in the brand new IMPACT KIT. Best of all, you can get it right now on super sale — but only during our global premiere event.

    title: " Why Use Straws on New Grass Seed ",
    content: `
One of the goals when planting a new lawn is keeping the grass seed in place until it germinates and establishes a root system to anchor it to the soil.
Another goal is to keep the newly planted seed sufficiently moist and warm to encourage germination.
Both goals can be achieved by placing a thin layer of straw over the grass and leaving it in place until grass seedlings appear.
Lastly, the straw prevents birds and other animals from eating the seeds before they germinate.

    title: " Preparing the soil to plant new grass ",

Optimum soil conditions result in successful seed germination and healthy turf growth. In order to prepare your soil for planting, do the following:
<br/>\bTest the soil\b. The correct soil pH is critical to a thriving lawn. The pH measures acidity and alkalinity on a scale from 0 to 14. According to the University of Missouri Extension, a soil pH from 6.0 to 7.5 is best for turf grass.
Your County Cooperative Extension office can provide you with soil testing kits and results or will refer you to a soil testing laboratory. When completing a soil test, make sure to collect soil from several areas of the yard. The soil test results will give you an accurate picture of the state of your soil's pH and nutrient levels.

<br/>\bAmend to alter pH\b. If your soil test shows that the pH is too high, which is common in the west, amend with elemental/soil sulfur. If your pH is too low, which is common in the northwest, northeast and southeast, amend with lime. Follow package directions carefully when amending.

<br/>\bAmend to add nutrients\b. Based on the recommendations outlined in your soil test, choose from one of Pennington's high-quality turf fertilizers. If your soil test indicates a deficiency in macronutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, till in lawn starter fertilizer as recommended on the product packaging at a depth of 4 to 6 inches, according to the Rutgers New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station.4 Also add micronutrients that the soil test indicates are deficient. For instance, for iron deficiency apply Ironite® Plus Lawn & Plant Food.

<br/>\bAmend to alter structure\b. If your soil is heavy and compacted or sandy, those conditions will affect seed germination, growth and the overall health of your lawn. It's important that your soil have sufficient air space in order to grow healthy grass, yet be bulky enough to retain and distribute to the grass nutrients and moisture.

<br/>Prepare the soil for good air circulation and water penetration by removing rocks and roots, and tilling in organic matter, such as compost, at a depth of 2 to 4 inches. To break up the soil and mix in ingredients, rent a tiller from your local hardware or garden store; to aerate existing lawns by pulling out plugs or making holes, rent an aerator.

    title: "  Preparing the site to plant new grass ",
    content: `
A healthy, attractive lawn starts with proper site preparation.
<br/>
Grading of the site prior to planting is important, as it will help ensure water retention and allow for easy mowing. The University of Maryland Extension advises sloping the lawn area away from buildings at a rate of 1 to 2 percent.2 Avoid steep slopes, as they tend to dry out, and make sure the area is level. Depressions create wet spots that are hard to mow and prone to disease.
<br/>
If you intend to replace the entire lawn, it's important to do a thorough job of removing the old turf. Use a sod cutter to take out the old grass at the roots. Another option for ridding the area of old turf is to spray the lawn with an herbicide, such as a product containing glyphosate.
<br/>
Apply according to product directions, wait 10 days and then re-spray any areas that are still green. Wait another 10 days to make sure that all of the turf is dead. Mow off the dead grass and rake it up. If the dead layer is too thick for raking, remove it with a sod cutter. After the area is clear of dead grass and you've graded the site, you can seed the lawn.`,

    title: "When is the right time of year to plant new grass seeds",
    content: `
Choose the right time of year to plant new grass.
<br/>
The time of year you plant grass seed has a direct effect on seeding success. Proper timing ensures that the grass effectively germinates, grows quickly and remains healthy while establishing.
<br/>
Early fall is the ideal time to plant grass seed, according to the University of Massachusetts Extension Turf Program.1 At this point, the ground is still warm enough to hasten germination, while the days are cool and sometimes rainy, helping to ensure that the seeds don't dry out. In early fall there is also still sufficient sunlight to allow new grass to thrive and become established before winter arrives.
<br/>
Spring seeding is your second best option. Aim to seed early in the season, before the weather warms up substantially. Spring also tends to bring periods of sunshine and rain, both of which contribute to strong growth.`,

Lawns face nuisances such as inclement weather, pests, and disease all the time.
<br/>
The key to overcoming these inevitable annoyances is to have a lawn that is well-maintained in the first place.

A lawn that receives regular mowing and overall maintenance will recover much more quickly than an unhealthy one. The longer your lawn goes without love and care, the harder it is for your lawn to bounce back to tip-top shape.`,

\bGetting an even growth of your lawn is not an easy task\b
<br/>
We’ve all seen yards that are patchy and uneven and I think we can all agree that they can be somewhat of an eyesore.
<br/>
Uneven grass growth is what causes this common lawn problem, but fortunately you can avoid this with regular mowing.
<br/>
When you slice the growth of your grass down to a short, uniform level on a regular basis, you are actually improving overall growth because there will be an even distribution and absorption of resources that come from the sun and water. Consistency in growth is crucial in maintaining a beautiful yard.
<br/>

You don’t want a yard full of weaklings do you? We didn’t think so.
<br/>
To get the strongest lawn possible, get it mowed as often as needed to keep it at around 3 inches in height.
<br/>
When your grass is cut, the healthiest grass shoots will flourish while the weak shoots are left behind.
<br/>
The more you get your lawn cut, the more healthy grass shoots you will have which results in a more lush and healthy lawn over time.
