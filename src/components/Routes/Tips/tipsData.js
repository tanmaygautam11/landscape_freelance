The soil is starving for organic matter.
<br/>Better garden, better lawn, better flowers, better veggies this summer, how to we do it? With compost.
<br/>Composting is literally making new soil. Have you ever tried it?! It’s like watching magic happen.
<br/>You can take “trash” and turn it into earthly treasure.
<br/>As much as 40% of our food is wasted and sent to landfills. There it produces methane, which accelerates climate change. Can you imagine a giant pile of food — and then taking 40% of it to throw directly into the trash?!
But there is never any waste in nature. Everything that dies becomes food for something else. By composting, we can participate in the natural flow of life and recycle vital nutrients back into our soil.
<br/>Composting May Be More Profound Than We Ever Thought
<br/>Only recently, Project Drawdown, an organization led by environmental researcher, Paul Hawken, produced a phenomenal report ranking the 100 Top Solutions for Climate Change. Their efforts specifically focused only on hard data, to ensure the research was backed up with bulletproof evidence, and so no one could discredit their arguments.
<br/>What they found surprised them...
<br/>After factoring in the methane emissions from food waste in landfills, reducing food waste turns out to be the number 1 solution overall to help heal our planet!
<br/>Want to find out how you can grow fabulous compost, even if you don’t have much space (and without creating bad smells, offending the neighbors, or attracting unwanted critters!)? Expert gardening teacher, Stacey Murphy, joined me to create a powerful video walking you through the simplest steps to get anyone and everyone turning food scraps into healthy new soil gold! And this is just ONE of the 15 expert video lessons included in the brand new IMPACT KIT. Best of all, you can get it right now on super sale — but only during our global premiere event.

    title: " Why Use Straws on New Grass Seed ",
    content: `
One of the goals when planting a new lawn is keeping the grass seed in place until it germinates and establishes a root system to anchor it to the soil.
Another goal is to keep the newly planted seed sufficiently moist and warm to encourage germination.
Both goals can be achieved by placing a thin layer of straw over the grass and leaving it in place until grass seedlings appear.
Lastly, the straw prevents birds and other animals from eating the seeds before they germinate.

    title: " Preparing the soil to plant new grass ",
    content: `
Optimum soil conditions result in successful seed germination and healthy turf growth. In order to prepare your soil for planting, do the following:
<br/>\bTest the soil\b. The correct soil pH is critical to a thriving lawn. The pH measures acidity and alkalinity on a scale from 0 to 14. According to the University of Missouri Extension, a soil pH from 6.0 to 7.5 is best for turf grass.
Your County Cooperative Extension office can provide you with soil testing kits and results or will refer you to a soil testing laboratory. When completing a soil test, make sure to collect soil from several areas of the yard. The soil test results will give you an accurate picture of the state of your soil's pH and nutrient levels.

<br/>\bAmend to alter pH\b. If your soil test shows that the pH is too high, which is common in the west, amend with elemental/soil sulfur. If your pH is too low, which is common in the northwest, northeast and southeast, amend with lime. Follow package directions carefully when amending.

<br/>\bAmend to add nutrients\b. Based on the recommendations outlined in your soil test, choose from one of Pennington's high-quality turf fertilizers. If your soil test indicates a deficiency in macronutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, till in lawn starter fertilizer as recommended on the product packaging at a depth of 4 to 6 inches, according to the Rutgers New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station.4 Also add micronutrients that the soil test indicates are deficient. For instance, for iron deficiency apply Ironite® Plus Lawn & Plant Food.

<br/>\bAmend to alter structure\b. If your soil is heavy and compacted or sandy, those conditions will affect seed germination, growth and the overall health of your lawn. It's important that your soil have sufficient air space in order to grow healthy grass, yet be bulky enough to retain and distribute to the grass nutrients and moisture.

<br/>Prepare the soil for good air circulation and water penetration by removing rocks and roots, and tilling in organic matter, such as compost, at a depth of 2 to 4 inches. To break up the soil and mix in ingredients, rent a tiller from your local hardware or garden store; to aerate existing lawns by pulling out plugs or making holes, rent an aerator.
